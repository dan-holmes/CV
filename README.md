## Daniel Holmes

I’m an analytically minded individual with a strong set of technical, mathematical and commercial skills.

I have a long standing interest in programming, underpinned by a degree in Mathematics with Computer Science from Durham University and most recently a 16 week intensive coding bootcamp at Makers Academy.

Having used scripting languages such as Python, R and SQL during my job as an analyst I am excited to expand my skill base and help create exciting new software and tools.
